Around the year 2011, Google digitally scanned in a great amount of books from
the 16\textsuperscript{th} and 17\textsuperscript{th}
century\cite{bloomburg2011}, also known as the Dutch ``Golden Age''. Many of
these books are now available freely online to read and download. OCR techniques
have been used in order to make some of the book's text available and
searchable. However, the images in the books can only be found by manually
searching through it. Since images are quite sparse in this kind of books,
this can be a tedious task.

Our goal is to extract these images automatically. This could be used to offer
the images separately to users, or make them searchable, like the text is
now. We approached the task as a supervised learning problem.

We have divided the this task in several subtasks. In section
\ref{sec:dataset} we discuss the dataset and the annotator program we built to
quickly obtain an annotated set of book pages.

As a proof of concept we first do a classification of the pages in
section \ref{sec:pageclas}.  Separating the pages with images from those without
them, could result in a speed-up in the annotating process: imagine if an
annotator would only have to specify where the images are on a page, rather than
go through hundreds of pages without any images at all.

Finally, the last step involves the actual problem. We find the bounding boxes of
images in section \ref{sec:imageloc} so that the actual images can be extracted
and presented separately.

All the code and the produced programs are available publicly at
