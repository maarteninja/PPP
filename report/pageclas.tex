\section{Page Classification}
\label{sec:pageclas}

The first step is to classify whether a page contains an image or not. This
serves two purposes. First, classifying such pages successfully serves as a
proof of concept that the representation suits the task at hand. And second, it
could save someone annotating new books some time if all
the pages that definitely do not contain images can be filtered out before the
annotating process begins.
