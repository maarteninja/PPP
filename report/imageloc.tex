\section{Image Localization}
\label{sec:imageloc}

For the final application of this research, we need only the images, in stead of
the entire page. In the past, HOG features have been used for localization, in combination
with a sliding window approach\cite{harzallah2009combining,
suard2006pedestrian}. With this approach, an image is divided into several,
overlapping sub-images which are overlapping. Each window is then classified by
the SVM in much the same way as the Page Classifier works. We wanted to try
something new.

A Conditional Random Field \cite{lafferty2001conditional} is a graph-based
statistical model in which the labeling for each node is dependant on the
labeling of its neighbouring nodes. Typically, a CRF has an energy function, and
a loss function that maximizes this energy function. This maximization can be
solved using structured solvers. A Structured SVM \cite{joachims2009cutting} was
selected as structured solver for this specific problem. 

\todo{Maybe we should have a reason for choosing the Structured SVM (other than
``it was in our library''), but I can't think of any...}

\todo{I'm not sure if we want to cite this paper here: artan2010prostate. It
does seem to be like what we're doing, but it's kind of hard to read and they
use a cost-sensitive SVM (which apparently is not the same as an SSVM)}
