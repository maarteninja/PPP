\section{Image Localization}
\label{sec:imageloc}
\todo{Explain goal of image localization, maybe (since this is a report and not
a paper) also explain we don't want to use the easiest method}

For the final application of this research, we need only the images, in stead of
the entire page. Hog features have been used for localization, in combination
with a sliding window approach\cite{harzallah2009combining,
suard2006pedestrian}. With this approach, an image is divided into several,
overlapping sub-images which are overlapping. Each window is then classified by
the SVM in much the same way as the Page Classifier works. We wanted to try
something new.

A Conditional Random Field \cite{lafferty2001conditional} is a statistical model
in which the labeling for each node is dependant of the labeling of the
neighbouring nodes.
