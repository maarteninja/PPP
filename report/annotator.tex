%\section{Annotator}
\label{sec:annotator}

An annotator was built, in order to quickly and easily annotate all the pages of
a book. When a book is downloaded, the annotator cycles through all its pages.
The user can then press a button on the keyboard indicating whether the page
contains an image, text, or neither. When the page contains one or several
images, the user has to drag a bounding box around the images, using the mouse,
prior to pressing the keyboard button. Because the majority of the pages are
text pages and the user only has to press 1 button per page, books can be
annotated fairly quickly with this tool.

Using this annotator and the Google Books website, a training set of annotated
book pages was created, containing 5960 pages from 23 books. The statistics of
this dataset can be seen in table \ref{tab:statistics}. A separate test set
containing 2868 pages from 4 books was created as well. Both sets can be
requested via E-mail.
\todo{Eigenlijk moeten we dus dezelfde statistieken over de testset opzoeken :(
Ik vind het niet superbelangrijk}
